Release Note:
-------------

This is version 1.4 of the BangDB Embedded Flavor. This is a stable version and 
is ready to be used in production or any environment as required.

Following additions have been made to this release compared to its earlier version;

a. DB is now much more memory efficient, runs within the supplied memory budget 
   under all condtions
b. Addition of shared log feature. Tables can share the same log (WAL) resulting 
   in saving huge memory and also less disk seeks
c. Shared and Private log available as option to the user with Shared being the 
   default
d. The background workers are much lighter and efficient for log and buffer pool
e. DB now returns error when unable to create new table or allocate resources, 
   earlier it used to quit
f. Improvement in prefetch cache, much less memory ovrhead, better prediction for 
   page prefetching
g. Overall performance improvement, espeically for reads
h. Few bug fixes

	b. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
	   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
3. The config file (bangdb.config) should be kept in the app directory , or the path should
